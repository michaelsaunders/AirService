                        <p id="answer1" class="answer">
                            When a customer requests a connection to your venue their name will appear on the
                            left of the venue iPad screen under the "waiting" tab. Simply tap on that customers
                            name, and accept their request. The customer is then free to start ordering!</p>

                            Tap the green 'yes' tick next to the order to accept it. A yellow paper plane will
                            then appear next to the order indicating it is being prepared for delivery.</p>

                        <p id="answer6" class="answer">
                            In the same way you usually would. We want AirService to be as transparent as possible
                            in your venue, and this means not messing with your existing point of sale systems.
                            Once the customer is done, you process their bill in exactly the same way as you
                            do now.</p>

                        <p id="answer7" class="answer">
                            Yes. You need a compatible AirPrint printer that works with an iPad, and from there
                            simply tapping on the Print Order History button will automatically print the order history for your
                            customer.</p>

                        <p id="answer8" class="answer">
                            When the customer connects, they specify their location to the staff member connecting
                            them at a venue iPad. The staff member then enters this information as part of accepting
                            the customer's connection request.

                        <p id="answer9" class="answer">
                            Simply tap on the customer's name and you can edit their location.</p>

                            What does "freezing" a customer do?</p>
                        <p id="answer10" class="answer">
                            Let's say a customer looks like they need a break from drinking, or is unruly, you can 'freeze' them.
                            This simply puts a block on their app for a set period of time giving you time to
                            send staff to calm them down or politely ask them to leave the venue. AirService
                            has been designed with Responsible Service of Alcohol regulations in mind.</p>

                            Yes, for example if you had a bar and a kitchen, all the drink orders could go to

                            AirService is very safe to use in your venue. All orders are encrypted, and AirService
                            does not interfere with your point of sale systems in any way. Further, you have full
                            control over which customers are able to use AirService in your venue (see the FAQ

                        <p id="answer24" class="answer">
                            Customers cannot place orders unless you have accepted their connection request and they have connected to your venue. For security, we recommend that before accepting a connection request you take the customer's credit card details or other identification details.<br /><br />
                            In additions to this, Customers can only be disconnected from your venue from a venue iPad. So unless you are satisfied they have paid their bill they will remain connected to your venue and you will be able to contact them.
                        You retain full control at all times.</p>
