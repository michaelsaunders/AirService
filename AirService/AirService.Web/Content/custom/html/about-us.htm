                About AirService</h3>
              <p>
                AirService is a hospitality ordering system developed by Australian mobile solutions
                company, Luxe Digital.</p>
<p>
            It is designed to streamline the ordering process by replacing the traditional paper
            menu and wait staff with the latest cutting edge technology.</p>
            <p>
                AirService allows customers to browse the available items of any outlet, be it
                an hotel, a restaurant, bar, cafe, or any establishment that would normally use
                a menu. Being able to view full colour photos, and read detailed descriptions of
                every item before ordering, makes using AirService not only fun, but incredibly
                useful too.</p>
