                                <li>clicking to accept or agree to the Terms, where this option is made available to

                                <li>by actually accessing or using the Services. In this case, you understand and agree

                            at all times, Luxe cannot guarantee that this will be the case. Luxe will use all
                            reasonable endeavours to post a notice on the Website prior to performing any maintenance
                            that will result in the Services being unavailable. Luxe is not responsible for
                            any problems associated with the use of the public internet.</li>
                        <li>The Services are designed for use only with certain devices or internet browsers,
                            and require certain functionality (such as javascript and cookies) to be enabled
                            in order to properly function. Details of these requirements are specified on the
                            Website. These requirements may change over time to reflect evolving technologies.
                            Luxe will provide you with reasonable notice of any such changes.</li>
                        <li>While Luxe endeavours to ensure that the Services are free from viruses and other
                            harmful code, you are responsible for taking appropriate steps (including the use
                            of up-to-date anti-virus and anti-spyware software) to protect your computer systems
                            from viruses and other harmful code.</li>

                            (the "<strong>Territory</strong>"). You may only access and use the Services within
                            the Territory.</li>
                        <li>Unless you and Luxe have specifically agreed otherwise in writing, you are responsible
                            for providing at your own cost all computer and telecommunications facilities that
                            you require in order to access and use the Services, and for configuring those facilities
                            (for example, by having appropriate security and firewall settings) so that you
                            can access and use the Services.</li>
                        <li>In order to access certain Services, you may be required to provide information

                            other than through the interface that is provided by Luxe, unless you have been
                            specifically allowed to do so in a separate written agreement with Luxe.</li>
                        <li>You agree that you will not engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts

                            with Luxe, you agree that you will not reproduce, duplicate, distribute, sell, trade
                            or resell the Services for any purpose.</li>

                            <p>
                                You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Luxe has no responsibility
                                to you or to any third party for):</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>any breach of your obligations under the Terms; and</li>
                                <li>the consequences (including any loss or damage which Luxe may suffer) of any such
                                    breach.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>You must ensure that if any of your employees or contractors are accessing or using
                            the Services on your behalf ("<strong>Users</strong>"), they comply with all of
                            your obligations under the Terms as if a reference to "you" included your Users.
                            You agree that you will be liable to Luxe for the acts and omissions of your Users
                            as fully as if they were your acts and omissions.</li>

                        Payment for the Services</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>This clause 4(i) applies where you are required to pay Luxe directly for your access
                            to any part of the Services ("Paid Services"). This includes Subscribers. Even if
                            you are not using any Paid Services, you may still incur charges incidental to your
                            access to or use of the Services, for example charges for internet access or cellular
                            network data transmissions.</li>
                        <li>You authorise Luxe to charge you for the Paid Services, using your specified payment
                            method, in the amounts, at the times and in the manner specified on the Website
                            (as updated from time to time), or otherwise as specified in a separate written
                            agreement between you and Luxe.</li>
                        <li>The price stated for the Paid Services includes GST and all other taxes, unless
                            stated otherwise.</li>
                        <li>You must be authorised to use the payment method that you enter when you create
                            a billing account with Luxe. You must keep all information in your billing account
                            current at all times. You can access and modify your billing account from the Website.
                            You may change your payment method at any time.</li>
                        <li>Unless Luxe notifies you otherwise, if you are participating in any free trial period
                            or similar offer in respect of the Paid Services, you must cancel your access to
                            the Paid Services before the end of the trial period to avoid incurring new charges.
                            If you do not cancel your access to the Paid Services before the end of the trial
                            period, you authorise us to charge you for the Paid Services, using your specified
                            payment method, from the end of the trial period.</li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Luxe will notify you in advance if we change the price of any of the Paid Services.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>If you have agreed to take any Paid Services for a specific period of time and at
                                    a specific price (referred to as a "<strong>Fixed Price Period</strong>" below),
                                    then the price will not change during the Fixed Price Period. After the Fixed Price
                                    Period ends, your access to the Paid Services will be charged at the new price unless
                                    you and Luxe agree otherwise.</li>
                                <li>If your Paid Services are offered on a periodic basis (for example, monthly), then
                                    Luxe will give you at least 30 days' notice before any price change.</li>
                            </ol>
                            If you do not agree to any price change, you must cancel your access to, and stop
                            using, the Paid Services before the date on which the price change is stated to
                            come into effect, or before the end of the current Fixed Price Period if applicable.
                            If you cancel, then your access to the Paid Services will end at the end of the
                            current Fixed Price Period or, if Luxe bills your account on a periodic basis, at
                            the end of the period in which you cancelled. </li>
                        <li>Except as specifically provided in the Terms, or where required by law, all charges
                            for the Paid Services are earned when received and non-refundable.</li>
                        <li>Luxe will provide you with an online tax invoice and billing statement via your
                            online billing account. You can view, print or request a paper copy of the tax invoice
                            and billing statement, but if you request a paper copy, Luxe may charge you an administration
                            fee.</li>
                        <li>If Luxe makes an error on your bill, we will correct it promptly after you tell
                            us and we investigate. You must tell Luxe within 90 days after an error first appears
                            on your bill. If you don't tell us within that time, Luxe won't be required to correct
                            the error, and you release Luxe from all liability and claims of loss or damage
                            resulting from the error. We may correct billing errors on our own initiative at
                            any time.</li>
                        <li>You may cancel your access to Paid Services at any time, with or without cause (including
                            where you terminate this agreement under clause 14(b)(i) of the Terms). Information
                            on how to cancel the Paid Services is available on the Website. If you are in a
                            Fixed Price Period, you may be required to pay some or all of the charges due for
                            the remainder of that Fixed Price Period. In some cases, you may also be required
                            to pay cancellation or administration charges.</li>
                        <li>Luxe may assess a late charge if you do not make any payment on time (for example,
                            because we are unable to receive payment via your specified payment method). You
                            must pay these late charges when we bill you for them. The late charges will be
                            calculated daily based on an annual interest rate of 4% above the average 90 day
