                            up a user account, or log in using your Facebook profile, Luxe records your name,

                            information to identify you and communicate with you about your AirService&trade;
                            account.</li>
                        <li>Each time you use the mobile application to place an order with a venue that offers
                            the AirService&trade; wireless menu and ordering system (the "AirService&trade;
                            System"), we also collect information about what you ordered and when, and the time
                            you left that venue. We need this information to ensure you receive the food, drinks
                            or other items you order.</li>

                            organisation registers on our website to access and use the AirService™ System.
                            We need this information about you and your business so we can provide the Services
                            you require as a subscriber. We only use this information for the purposes of our
                            business relationship with you.</li>

                            About other individuals</h5>

                            and Twitter pages, or through other social media and online channels. We use this
                            information for the purposes of engaging in an online conversation with those individuals.</li>

                        How does Luxe use personal information?</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Generally, we only use personal information for the purposes of providing you with
                            the Services you require.</li>
                        <li>Sometimes we might also use personal information to send you information about your
                            AirService™ account, about new features of the Services or special offers, or about
                            other products or services we think may be relevant or useful to you. If at any
                            time you want to opt out from receiving this kind of information, please let us
                            know by sending us email to admin@luxedigital.net.</li>
                        <li>Otherwise, we will only use personal information with your consent, or if we are
                            required or permitted by law to do so (for example, under the NPPs in the Privacy
                            Act).</li>

                        Who does Luxe usually disclose personal information to?</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Luxe generally only discloses your personal information to other persons or organisations
                            for the purposes of providing you with the Services you require.</li>
                        <li>Most importantly, if you are using the mobile application to place orders with venues
                            that offer the AirService™ System, we will give those venues access to information
                            about you and your orders. The venues will use this information to provide you with
                            the food, drinks or other items you have ordered, and also to keep track of how
                            their business is going.</li>
                        <li>Luxe relies on third party contractors to provide certain services necessary for
                            our business, and sometimes a contractor may need access to your personal information
                            in order to provide the services we require. While they vary from time to time,
                            these contractors may include organisations that supply the servers and networks
                            that host our website and allow us to operate the AirService™ System, organisations
                            that provide marketing and communication services on our behalf and other information
                            technology contractors.</li>
                        <li>Whenever we disclose your personal information to third party contractors, we will
                            endeavour to ensure that the recipient:
                            <ul>
                                <li>only uses the information for the specific purpose(s) for which it is provided to

                                <li>stores the information securely, and either destroys it or returns it to Luxe when
                                    it is no longer needed.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Otherwise, we will only disclose personal information with your consent, or if we
                            are required or permitted by law to do so (for example, under the NPPs in the Privacy
                            Act).</li>

                            we are no longer required to retain personal information, we ensure that it is disposed
                            of or destroyed in a secure fashion in accordance with our obligations under the
