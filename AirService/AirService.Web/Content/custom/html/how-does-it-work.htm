            <h3>
                How Does AirService Work?</h3>
            <h4>
                How It Works for Customers</h4>
            <p>
                Using AirService is remarkably easy. First, download the app from iTunes to your iPhone,
                iPad or iPod Touch.</p>
            <p>
                Next, simply open the app and let it locate which venue you're in via GPS. If it
                gets it wrong, or if you want to check in to a different venue, simply choose from
                the list of nearby venues or from your favourites list, or search for a venue by
                name.</p>
            <p>
                Once you've confirmed your venue, AirService will download the appropriate menu
                to your i-device. You'll now be able to browse the menu and decide if you like what
                you see. Once you're ready to start ordering, simply press "Connect to venue" and
                see a member of staff to confirm your connection.</p>
            <p>
                You're now ready to order! Your orders will go straight from your i-device to the
                venue's iPad, where they'll be prepared and brought directly to you. No standing
                in queues, no waiting around while your order is prepared, just fast and efficient
                service.</p>
            <p>
                And when you're ready to leave, it's just a couple of clicks to request your bill.</p>
            <h4>
                Of course, there are a number of other cool features as well:</h4>
            <ul class="features">
                <li>Re-order your past orders with one click (great when ordering rounds of drinks)</li>
                <li>Pre-order for delivery at any time (champagne at midnight anyone..?)</li>
                <li>View photos and extended descriptions of the goods available (not sure what Paté 
                    looks like?)</li>
                <li>Keep track of the amount you've spent, and easily view your order history</li>
                <li>You can even set an alert for when you've spent a certain amount (no more nasty
                    shocks)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>
                How It Works for Venues</h4>
            <p>
                AirService is just as easy to set up and use for a venue as it is for a customer.
                To get started, simply sign up via the box up in the top right corner of
                this page… </p>
            <p>
                Once you've signed up, it's quick and easy to customise your app and upload your menu.            </p>
            <p>
                Once you're confirmed, all you need to do is set up an iPad (or two... or three...)
                wherever you want your customer's orders to be received.</p>
            <p>
                When a customer wants to start ordering they simply send you a connection request
                which you'll see as an alert on your iPad, plus the customer will be prompted to
                speak to a member of your staff to complete the connection.</p>
            <p>
                At this point, before accepting the connection request, for security you may want
                to hold on to the customer's credit card, or take their credit card details.</p>
            <p>
                Confirming a connection is as easy as entering where in your venue the customer
                will be located for delivery of their orders, then hitting "Confirm connection".</p>
            <p>
                From there, you will receive orders from that customer
                on your iPads. From there you simply accept the orders, prepare them, and deliver
                them to the customer! Nothing easier!</p>
