                        <p>
                            Why was huge amounts of time and money testing and maintaining an app from scratch.
                            With AirService you can customise the app to match the rest of your brand and make
                            it truly yours. Choose your colours, select from our recommended backgrounds or
                            upload your own, and add your logo quickly and easily right from the AirService
                            website. You can even editit at any time, and the app will automatically change on all your customers
                            iPhones and iPads.</p>

                            Do you serve from more than one spot at your venue? No problem, with AirService
                            you can split your incoming orders. Want your drinks to go to one bar, and food
                            orders to go to the kitchen? Consider it done.</p>

                            Don't want to deliver your customer's orders to them? AirService is still working
                            for you. Use the pick up option, and when a customer's order is ready they'll be
                            sent an alert to come pick it up, along with a number to identify their order. Do
                            away with those buzzers that are always breaking down or going missing. Or dedicate
                            an area to receiving and preparing orders so that you have a continual flow of customers
                            just coming past to pick up their orders once they're ready. Remove bottlenecks
                            as customers queue to order and then wait for their order to be prepared, and really
                            maximise the efficiency of your venue!!

                        <p>
                            We've even set aside space on the homepage of the app for you to include some advertising.
                            This can be set to change every day, so you might choose to advertise happy hour
                            on a Monday, include a sponsor's logo on a Tuesday, and advertise a special on a
                            Wednesday. You can even rent this bit of advertising space to another company. The
                            possibilities are endless. Or you can switch this feature off if you'd rather do
                            without.</p>

                            AirService allows you to really draw your customers in with your menus. Upload beautiful
                            photos of your goods. Include a description if you like, maybe nutritional details
                            for food? Plus, AirService isn't for just food and drinks. Anything that can be
                            listed can be offered through AirService. Massages, in-house movies, reservations,
                            let your imagination run free...</p>

                            Does your venue have more than one menu which run at different times? Like a breakfast
                            menu, lunch menu and dinner menu? Or a special happy hour menu that only runs on
                            Tuesdays at 6pm? With AirService it's not a problem. Upload your menus and set the
                            times for each. AirService will automatically stop and start the menus at the correct
                            time, so your customers see the correct menu without any hassle for you.</p>

                            AirService offers a great range of analytical tools to better understand the ordering
                            habits of your customers. See that they usually order a pina colada from the pool
                            bar, but hardly ever order a beer at the same time as a cheese sandwich.</p>
