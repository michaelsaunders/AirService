                <h4>FAQs for Customers</h4>
                <ul class="faq-list">
                    <li class="first">
                        <p id="question1" class="question close">
                            How do I check-in at a venue?</p>
                        <p id="answer1" class="answer">
                            Simply open the app and either check-in at the location where AirService has located
                            you, or  tap "Search Location" to find the venue you're looking for.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p id="question2" class="question close">
                            How do I connect to a venue and start ordering?</p>
                        <p id="answer2" class="answer">
                            Once you've checked-in at a venue you'll see up the top of the home screen a prompt
                            to connect. Simply tap that and you're good to go!</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p id="question3" class="question close">
                            Can I view the menu without connecting to the venue?</p>
                        <p id="answer3" class="answer">
                            Absolutely. Simply open the app and check-in at the venue. The menu will download
                            to your phone and you'll be able to view it at your leisure. Once you're ready to
                            order simply connect to the venue and start ordering. (see FAQ "How do I start
                            ordering?")</p>

                            How do I re-order a past order?</p>
                        <p id="answer4" class="answer">
                            When you click on My Orders, you will notice a button at the top right of the screen
                            called 'Past Orders'. From here you can view all your previous orders from the past
                            24 hours and re-order any of them with just one click.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p id="question5" class="question close">
                            How do I place an order for a later time?</p>
                        <p id="answer5" class="answer">
                            Place your order as usual, however when you come to the My Order screen you
                            will notice a Place my Order section at the bottom of the order. By default this is
                            set to 'ASAP', however by tapping the arrow, you can set the order time to a different
                            time. Perfect for those moments when you want to plan ahead, perhaps for dinner
                            later that night, or a romantic bottle of champagne to be delivered at that perfect
                            moment.</p>

                            What if there's a problem with my order?</p>
                        <p id="answer6" class="answer">
                            No problem, simply talk to a member of staff, they can assist you with your order.</p>

                            Why did I receive a message from the venue I'm connected to?</p>
                        <p id="answer7" class="answer">
                            AirService can be used to send you messages that will improve service for you, like advising that your table is ready. To keep you up to date with the latest offers, AirService venues are also allowed to
                            send all currently connected customers  up to 2 messages per hour. These messages may
                            contain special offers or alert you to events that are currently happening in your
                            vicinity. </p>

                            Can I connect to more than one venue at once?</p>
                        <p id="answer8" class="answer">
                            You can. This means that you can easily move between venues without having to settle
                            your account. For example if you're connected to a hotel while staying there, but
                            also want to connect to  a particular bar or restaurant that you're
                          visiting that night.<br />

                            How do I view which venues I'm connected to?</p>
                        <p id="answer9" class="answer">
                            If you tap on the Settings tab in the app you can view all venues you're currently
                            connected to. You can also view your current order history at each venue.</p>

                            How do I disconnect from a venue?</p>
                        <p id="answer10" class="answer">
                            You can only disconnect from a venue once you have paid your bill. To pay your bill
                            tap on View Bill on the app home screen and this will bring up your current bill.
                            From there tap "Request checkout to pay" and follow the prompts!</p>

                            How do I add a venue to my favourites list?</p>
                        <p id="answer11" class="answer">
                            After you have checked-in you will see a small heart at the top of the screen. Tapping
                            this icon will automatically add the venue to your favourites.</p>
                    </li>

                        <p id="question12" class="question close">
                            How do I pre-set the amount I want to spend at a venue?</p>
                        <p id="answer12" class="answer">
                            You can set your maximum spend alert through the Settings tab on the app. Once you've
                            reached this amount, AirService will alert you that you are now spending beyond
                            your set limit. Of course, you can override it if you want to keep ordering.</p>

                            We strongly recommend making sure your profile has a clear picture of you to help

                            Why do I need push notifications enabled to use AirService</p>
                        <p id="answer15" class="answer">
                            AirService relies on push notifications to provide its service to you. It needs
                            to send you push notifications to keep you informed about any orders you place.
